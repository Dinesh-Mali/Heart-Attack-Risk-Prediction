# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
In this App, we are predicting the risk of heart attack from the medical reports of a person, using KNN, SVM and other ML algorithms. 

# Introduction
Main Aim of this project is to predict whether a person is having a risk of heart attack or not, using ML/DL techniques.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
